/*
* Compiler Optimizations - 
* - Loop unrolling, splitting, fusion
* - Function inlining
* - Precompute values
* - Reordering operatinos

* gcc -O3 0_Optimize.c. O can have three levels O {0,1,2,3}

* -Ofast tries to optimize even more with non-standard stuff
* -O2 is a good choice. Linux kernel uses -O2
